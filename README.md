# CompMethods_Astro23

This repository contains solutions for the homeworks from the class Computational Methods for Astrophysics taught by Yosef Zlochover at RIT. 

Please use it for your reference, but not just copy my code. 

Feel free to comment on my code, ask questions and offer better solutions. Happy to collaborate with yall!
