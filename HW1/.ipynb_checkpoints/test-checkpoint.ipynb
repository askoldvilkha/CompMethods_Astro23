    "Equal-spaced centered finite differencing method allows user to evaluate the derivative with a chosen order of accuracy. The method is based on Taylor expansion of the function, so we know the order of accuracy. In general, for this method we have to choose $N+1$ points for our stencil, where $N$ is the order of accuracy. Therefore, we will have $N/2$ points to the left of the test point on $x$ axis, $N/2$ points to the right, and one central test point $x_0$. Therefore, our stencil is $\\left\\{x_{-N/2},\\dots,x_0,\\dots,x_{N/2}\\right\\}$. Here, $x_n = x_0 + n*h$. Note, that for this method $N$ has to be even, in other case, we will have to either skip the test point, or not have a symmetric stencil, which is contrary to method's main idea. Odd orders of accuracy are allowed for forward and backward finite difference methods. They require $N$ points to the right or left from the test point $x_0$, and do not require symmetry. $\\\\$\n",
